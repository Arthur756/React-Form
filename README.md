### React JS

This app is bootstrapped with React.js(https://pt-br.reactjs.org), you can access the database of this project by [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/pt-br).

## About
React. js is an open-source JavaScript library that is used for building user interfaces specifically for single-page applications. It's used for handling the view layer for web and mobile apps. React also allows us to create reusable UI components.

## :hammer: Bootstrap

<img alt="style image" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b2/Bootstrap_logo.svg" width="200px">

```bash
Quickly design and customize responsive mobile-first sites with Bootstrap, the world’s most popular front-end open source toolkit, featuring Sass variables and mixins, responsive grid system, extensive prebuilt components, and powerful JavaScript plugins.
```

## Installation
Install Bootstrap’s source Sass and JavaScript files via npm, Composer, or Meteor.

Package managed installs don’t include documentation or our full build scripts. You can also use our npm template repo to quickly generate a Bootstrap project via npm.

```bash
npm install bootstrap
```


```bash
gem install bootstrap -v 5.1.3
```
<br/>

## jsDelivr
When you only need to include Bootstrap’s compiled CSS or JS, you can use jsDelivr.

See it in action with our simple starter template, or browse the examples to jumpstart your next project. You can also choose to include Popper and our JS separately.

```bash
<!-- CSS only -->
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" integrity="sha384-1BmE4kWBq78iYhFldvKuhfTAU6auU8tT94WrHftjDbrCEXSU1oBoqyl2QvZ6jIW3" crossorigin="anonymous">
```


```bash
<!-- JavaScript Bundle with Popper -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" integrity="sha384-ka7Sk0Gln4gmtz2MlQnikT1wXgYsOg+OMhuP+IlRH9sENBO0LRn5q+8nbTov4+1p" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```

## :hammer: Formik

<img alt="style image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4060187/61057426-4e5a4600-a3c3-11e9-9114-630743e05814.png" width="200px">


## About
Formik started by expanding on this little higher order component by Brent Jackson, some naming conventions from Redux-Form, and (most recently) the render props approach popularized by React-Motion and React-Router 4. Whether you have used any of the above or not, Formik only takes a few minutes to get started with.

## Installation
You can install Formik with NPM, Yarn, or a good ol' <script> via unpkg.com.


```bash
 npm install formik --save
```
  

```bash
  yarn add formik
```
<br/>

## :hammer: Yup

<img alt="style image" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/904/1*eYYtH7FRS5oIIyzQMt9goQ.png" width="200px">


## About
It can be used with HTML input fields and custom validation rules, or Yup and the custom components it provides. ... When paired with Yup, they abstract all the complexities that surround handling forms in React. Yup is a JavaScript object schema validator.  
  
## Installation
Yup always relies on the Promise global object to handle asynchronous values as well as Set and Map. For browsers that do not support these, you'll need to include a polyfill, such as core-js:


```bash
npm install -S yup
```
  
<br/>

## :hammer: MongoDB

<img alt="style image" src="https://wallpapercave.com/wp/wp8725088.jpg" width="200px">

```bash
db.runCommand( { hello: 1 } )
```

## About
MongoDB is an open source NoSQL database management program. NoSQL is used as an alternative to traditional relational databases. NoSQL databases are quite useful for working with large sets of distributed data. MongoDB is a tool that can manage document-oriented information, store or retrieve information.
